# Exercise Images Guide

## How to Add Exercise Images

### Option 1: Use Supabase Storage (Recommended)

1. **Create Storage Bucket in Supabase:**
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Click "Storage" in the sidebar
   - Create a new bucket called `exercise-images`
   - Make it **public**

2. **Upload Images:**
   - Upload exercise images/GIFs to the bucket
   - Recommended format: JPG or PNG (or GIF for animated demos)
   - Recommended size: 800x600px or 16:9 aspect ratio

3. **Get Image URLs:**
   - Click on an uploaded image
   - Copy the public URL
   - Format: `https://ttkdbdfezvyigdegfiwm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/exercise-images/cat-cow.jpg`

4. **Update Exercise Records:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE exercises 
   SET thumbnail_url = 'https://ttkdbdfezvyigdegfiwm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/exercise-images/cat-cow.jpg'
   WHERE name = 'Cat-Cow Stretch';
   ```

### Option 2: Use Free Exercise Image APIs

**Wger Workout Manager (Free & Open Source):**
- API: https://wger.de/api/v2/
- Example: https://wger.de/api/v2/exercise/345/images/
- Images are CC-licensed

**Exercise.com:**
- Has free tier with exercise images
- Requires API key

### Option 3: Use External Image URLs

You can use any public image URL:

```sql
UPDATE exercises 
SET thumbnail_url = 'https://example.com/exercise-images/bird-dog.jpg'
WHERE name = 'Bird Dog';
```

### Batch Update All Exercises

```sql
-- Example: Update multiple exercises at once
UPDATE exercises SET thumbnail_url = 'https://your-cdn.com/cat-cow.jpg' WHERE name = 'Cat-Cow Stretch';
UPDATE exercises SET thumbnail_url = 'https://your-cdn.com/childs-pose.jpg' WHERE name = 'Child''s Pose';
UPDATE exercises SET thumbnail_url = 'https://your-cdn.com/knee-to-chest.jpg' WHERE name = 'Knee to Chest Stretch';
-- ... repeat for all exercises
```

## Current Exercise List

Here are all the exercises in your database that need images:

1. Cat-Cow Stretch (stretching)

## Placeholder Behavior

**Current Implementation:**
- If `thumbnail_url` is null/empty: Shows large emoji based on category
- If `thumbnail_url` exists: Shows actual image

**Category Emojis:**
- stretching: üßò
- core: üí™
- balance: ü§∏
- strengthening: üèãÔ∏è
- mobility: üîÑ

## Testing

After adding images, test:
1. Visit `/exercises` - Should see image cards
2. Click an exercise - Should see larger image at top
3. Mobile view - Images should be responsive
