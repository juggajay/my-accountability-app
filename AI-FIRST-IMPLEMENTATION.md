## Database Schema

### New Tables

1. **food_logs** - Meal tracking with nutrition data
   - Columns: meal_type, description, calories, protein, carbs, fat, health_score
   - Auto-updates daily_nutrition_summary via trigger

2. **photo_archive** - Universal photo storage
   - Stores photos as base64 or URLs
   - Saves AI analysis results as JSONB
   - Types: meal, receipt, exercise, posture

3. **activity_logs** - General activity tracking
   - Flexible logging for any activity
   - Mood tracking (before/after)
   - Energy levels

4. **nutrition_goals** - User dietary targets
   - Daily calorie/protein/carb/fat goals
   - Dietary preferences & restrictions
   - One row per user

5. **daily_nutrition_summary** - Automated daily aggregation
   - Auto-calculated by database trigger
   - Total calories, macros, meal count
   - Average health score

## How It Works

### 1. User Input Flow

```
User ‚Üí AIConversationCard ‚Üí /api/ai/universal-input ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí Database
```

**Text Input:**
1. User types: "I spent $50 on groceries"
2. Command parser identifies intent: `log_spending`
3. Extracts entities: `amount: 50, category: groceries`
4. Inserts into `spending` table
5. Returns confirmation with insights

**Photo Input:**
1. User uploads food photo
2. Photo classifier detects type: `meal`
3. GPT-4 Vision analyzes: "Chicken breast with broccoli and rice"
4. Estimates: 520 calories, 45g protein, 52g carbs, 8g fat
5. Stores in `food_logs` + `photo_archive`
6. Triggers daily summary update
7. Returns friendly confirmation

### 2. Context Engine

The AI maintains awareness of:
- Recent activities (last 7 days)
- Health trends (pain, exercise, alcohol)
- Spending patterns (impulse purchases, categories)
- Nutrition trends (calories, meal frequency)
- AI memories (important facts about you)
- Active goals
- Behavioral patterns

Context is loaded automatically on every conversation and used to personalize responses.

### 3. Command Types

**Supported Intents:**
- `log_spending` - Record purchases
- `log_food` - Log meals (text or photo)
- `log_pain` - Track pain levels
- `log_exercise` - Record workouts
- `log_alcohol` - Track drinking
- `log_mood` - Mood check-ins
- `conversational` - General chat (falls through to AI Coach)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

1. Open your Supabase project
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy entire contents of `database-migration-full.sql`
4. Run the script
5. Verify tables created:
   - food_logs
   - photo_archive
   - activity_logs
   - nutrition_goals
   - daily_nutrition_summary

### Step 2: Environment Variables

Ensure you have:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "AI-first transformation complete"
git push
```

Vercel will auto-deploy.

### Step 4: Test Features

**Test Natural Language:**
- "I spent $100 on new shoes"
- "Had a cheeseburger and fries for lunch"
- "Pain level 6 in lower back"
- "Just finished a 5k run"

**Test Photo Upload:**
- Click camera icon
- Upload food photo
- Wait for AI analysis
- Verify nutrition logged

**Test Voice Input:**
- Click microphone icon
- Say: "I ate pasta for dinner"
- Verify it transcribes and logs

## Cost Estimates

**GPT-4o Vision (Food/Receipt Analysis):**
- ~$0.01 per photo analysis
- 100 photos/month ‚âà $1.00

**GPT-4o (Command Parsing):**
- ~$0.0001 per command
- 1000 commands/month ‚âà $0.10

**GPT-3.5-turbo (Conversations):**
- ~$0.0001 per message
- 1000 messages/month ‚âà $0.10

**Estimated Monthly Total:** ~$1.50-$3.00 for moderate use

## Architecture Decisions

### Why GPT-4o for Vision?
- Most accurate for food/receipt analysis
- Handles complex receipts with multiple items
- Reliable calorie/macro estimation
- Worth the cost for quality

### Why Base64 for Photos?
- No separate storage setup required
- Instant analysis
- Easy to implement
- Can migrate to cloud storage later if needed

### Why Database Triggers?
- Real-time nutrition summary updates
- No cron jobs needed
- Atomic consistency
- Zero maintenance

### Why Command Parser?
- Deterministic intent detection
- Structured data extraction
- Easier to debug than pure LLM
- Consistent behavior

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 8 (Optional)
- [ ] Medication reminders
- [ ] Weekly AI reports via email
- [ ] Goal suggestions from AI
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Export data to CSV/PDF

### Phase 9 (Advanced)
- [ ] Wearable integrations (Fitbit, Apple Health)
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Social features (accountability partners)
- [ ] Custom AI personality settings

## Troubleshooting

### "Table does not exist" error
- Run database migration script in Supabase SQL Editor
- Verify all 5 new tables exist

### Photo upload not working
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set
- Try smaller image (< 2MB)

### Voice input not working
- Only works in Chrome, Edge, Safari
- Requires HTTPS (or localhost)
- Grant microphone permission

### AI not logging commands
- Check `/api/ai/universal-input` logs in Vercel
- Verify command parser is detecting intent
- Try more explicit phrasing: "Log spending $50 groceries"

## Support

For issues:
1. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs --follow`
2. Check Supabase logs in dashboard
3. Open browser DevTools console
4. Review error messages
